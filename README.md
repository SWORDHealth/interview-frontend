# :rocket: SWORD Health Interview Exercise

Engineers at SWORD Health are working to **free 2 billion people from physical
pain**.
To reach this goal we need to build innovative solutions using the best technologies,
techniques, and standards that exist in the industry.
This exercise is designed to evaluate several skills expected as part of this role.
We understand that compared with other interview processes this one might take longer
to solve.
However this helps ensure that you will be working with a team of engineers that
has the necessary practical skills for the role.

## :memo: Instructions

Before you start make sure you read carefully the sections below :arrow_down:.

### :+1: Shoulds

You should:

- Generate a project structure using [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/)
  and choose the configuration you feel more comfortable with.
- Implement the requirements mentioned in the [Challenge](CHALLENGE.md).
- Keep the solution simple and concise.
- Include the tests you would expect to find in a commercial grade product.

### :-1: Should Nots

You should not:

- Copy any code from a 3rd party to complete the exercise, this will result
  in disqualification.
- Rely on code generation tools.
- Use any external libraries, exception to this rule are the tools available in
  Vue CLI and libraries for UI components.
- Have advanced features, we encourage you to provide documentation on anything
  extra you consider relevant for a production ready implementation.

> :warning: focus on the "Shoulds" above as we do not give extra credit for things
  outside of that scope.
